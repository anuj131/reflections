When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When a project has contributions from multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Local changes will be lost if they are not committed.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	
	This helps us in being aware of the changes that have happened on the remote repository since the time of last sync and merge them into working directory.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	Without git, the team must be in constanct communication on reviewing the changes before moving the changes to staging/development environment. It would be a lot easier with git is in place for collaboration. It would be harder to merge, view history and identify the conflicts in merges without git.
