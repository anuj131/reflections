How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is a place where the files that are to be committed will be present. Working directory contains all the file/folder of the project. Repository contains the files that are committed from and pushed. 

Staging area lets us know which files are to be committed and helps us seperate the files that are ready to be committed with the ones that are not.
